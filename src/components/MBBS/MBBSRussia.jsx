                    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-green-600 mb-4">Direct Admission for Indian or International Students</h3>
                    <p className="text-left text-justify text-md lg:text-lg font-roboto mt-4">The major drawback of the Indian education system is that candidates who cannot make it into the merit list after appearing in the entrance exam have very limited options left for them. They have to either wait for another year or choose MBBS abroad. The best thing is that Indian students do not have to go through the entrance examination to get admission in Government Medical Universities in Russia. Admission in medical courses is offered to international and Indian students on a first come, first serve basis till the last seat is grabbed. </p>
