The University was founded on the basis of the Ukhta Industrial Institute (the Institute was founded in 1967). By this time, more than 25000 engineers and economists had graduated in oil, geology, building, and timber industry majors. After the successful attestation on April 14, 1999, the Institute was granted a status of a State Technical University. Our engineers became mayors and ministers, heads of educational establishments, enterprises, and banks. 423 instructors and scientific workers teach at The University. Among them are 53 Professors with Doctors of Science and 213 Associate professors with Masters of Science. </p>
