                            With origins dating back to 1915, Southern Federal University (SFedU) is the largest scientific and educational center in the south of Russia. SFedU traces its roots to the Royal University of Warsaw, which moved to the south of Russia during the Great War. We are widely recognized as one of the best universities in Russia for academic excellence, interdisciplinary research, and social commitment. Today, nearly 24,000 students, including 2,500 international students, are enrolled on two university campuses located in Rostov-on-Don and in Taganrog.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Engineering courses are delivered at the Taganrog campus, while the Rostov campus offers a wide range of courses in Sciences and Humanities. SFedU offers 86 Bachelor’s degree programs, 126 Master’s degree programs, and 26 doctoral programs. The quality of academic programs is confirmed by German accreditation bodies: ACQUIN and AQAS.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The university’s strong international outlook is demonstrated by the proportion of international students, 25 Erasmus+ destinations, 60 exchange agreements, and 10 double-degree partnerships. SFedU is actively involved in the Bologna process and its graduates receive European Diploma Supplement. SFedU conducts world-level research in information technologies, smart materials, nanotechnologies, medicine of the future, and robotics. Students can conduct research and make prototypes at SFedU international laboratories, shared-use equipment centers, and engineering centers. The students have free access to the e-refereed scientific journals. The SFedU has a wealth of facilities on campus to meet students’ needs in research, innovation, and development from state-of-the-art equipment, and business incubators to our Sports Center.
